I enjoyed working on this project. It allowed me to really understand how far I have come as a programmer. The Idea that
I would be here able to code something, admidantly relatively simple, would have never crossed my mind 2 years ago. I'm 
really happy with the free form of this project as It allowed me to be excited and determined to make something I could
be proud of. 

This project really allowed me to get a handle on maps and running them in and with functions. I feel way more comfortable
with them than I did during the midterm. I believe the map problem was the only problem I missed on the midterm. They are 
so useful, especially when combined with function pointers(the other main component of my project). I struggled with the 
sytax neccesary to use them, and I wonder if I will ever get sytax down when it comes to coding. Luckily for me, I have 
this great resource called the internet to remind me whenever I forget. I think I will one day be able to code a pointer
from memory, it will just be awhile until then. 

I chose C++ as the coding language, because it was the language I was most comfortable with. I am glad I did this for a few
reasons. 1) I did not struggle with looking up every function I needed to do what I wanted. 2) It allowed me to really start
building further upon my skills in C++, I would like to be very proficient in this language, rather than struggling with
multiple languages. Until I am confident in my C++ skills I want to focus primarily on them while occasionally dipping into 
other languages, mastering 1 at a time rather than focusing on building proficiency in many all at once. 

As my concluding remarks, I just want to say thank you for another good semester(despite the whole quarantine), and I can't
wait to have you again next semester. 

Bye for now!
