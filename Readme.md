# Final Project
## Text based adventure

I was thinking of doing a text based adventure in C++. This would include a decision tree in the form of dialogue options,
sorting and potentially unordered maps for inventory purposes(I haven't fully thought out how I would implement this), and if
I have enough time I might include a combat system with health and damage. I am tempted to try something in unity, but I fear
that would be too much for me to handle, so I wanted to do something that seems more reasonable.

P.S. I don't really know the requirements for the final project so if I have missed something, I will try to find a good way
of adding it in.
