# Final Project
## Text based adventure

This is my Text based adventure game
Current Features:

3 encounters each with a separate enemy to fight
-Goblins(goblins)
-Coloseum(goliath and shoulder goblin)
-Forrest(assassin)

3 items
-Bandage(heals 15hp)
-Sword(adds 1 to player damage)
-Shield(adds 1 to player defense)


Currently using an item does not remove it from your inventory list. It is however removed from your inventory, so any item
you have used cannot be used again. This can be decieving when you type inventory and recieve a list of items you may or may
not have. In the furture, I will spend more time on figuring out how to remove specific parts of a vector or change what I 
am using for my inventory. For now though It works just not perfectly. 

As a heads up, the forest is deadly and statistically imposible at the begging of the game. I would recomend starting with
the coloseum and using the shield obtained from there in a goblin fight to boost defense while obataining a bandage.

The one downside to the game is that only 1 strategy is realistically viable and it quickly outpaces the fights as you get further 
into the game. Fixing this is relatively easy as I just need to add more enemies. As it is, my goal for this project  
was to prove my current level of proficiency and not my game balancing skills(Nonexistant). In the future, I will 
spend more time on balancing and extra features.
